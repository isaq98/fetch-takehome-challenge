# Fetch Takehome Challenge

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Running the Project

If you'd like to run a local instance, this is a React app so you could accomplish this in three steps:

### Clone the Repo
Get the code into whatever IDE you prefer and then run the following commands:

### `npm i`
Will install all necessary dependencies for the project

### `npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.


Thanks!
